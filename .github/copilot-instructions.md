<!-- Documentation guideline: keep API/component usage docs current -->
- **Documentation maintenance:** When adding new components or new API request helpers, update the following files to keep usage maps current:
	- `client/src/APIUsage.md` — map new API helpers to files that import them.
	- `client/src/components/ComponentUsage.md` — record where new components are used and mark unused components for follow-up.
