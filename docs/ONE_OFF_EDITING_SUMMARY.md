# One-Off Item Editing - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **Allow Member Assignment Editing**
**Problem**: Member assignments were incorrectly disabled for one-off items.

**Fix**: Member assignments for one-off items are stored on the master item (just like regular items), so they should be fully editable in the drawer.

**Implementation** (`client/src/components/ItemEditDrawer.tsx`):
- Removed the disabled state for member assignment checkboxes when editing one-offs
- Updated save logic to:
  - Skip category updates for one-offs (they don't have categories)
  - Process member assignment updates for one-offs (same as regular items)
- Updated success message: "One-off item updated."

### 2. **Auto-Refresh After Save**
**Problem**: After editing a one-off item name, the packing list view didn't refresh to show the new name.

**Fix**: The `onSaved` callback in `PackingListsSideBySide` already calls `onRefresh()` - this automatically refreshes the packing list after any item edit.

**Verification**: No code changes needed - the refresh mechanism was already in place and working.

## Data Architecture (Clarified)

Both one-off and regular items store their data the same way:

```
Master Item (items table)
├─ name          ← Stored here
├─ isOneOff      ← 1 for one-offs, 0 for regular
├─ categoryId    ← NULL for one-offs, set for regular items
└─ Member assignments (via item_members, item_whole_family tables)
   ├─ Stored here for BOTH one-off and regular items
   └─ Editable in ItemEditDrawer for both types
```

The key difference:
- **Regular items**: Have categories, can be added to templates
- **One-off items**: No categories, used for trip-specific items

## UI Behavior

### One-Off Items
- Top note: "One-off items do not have categories. Changes to name and assignments apply to this item only."
- **Name field**: ✅ Editable
- **Category section**: ❌ Disabled (with helper text)
- **Member assignments**: ✅ Fully editable (whole family toggle + individual member checkboxes)
- **Save button**: Enabled when name is non-empty
- After save: Shows "One-off item updated." and refreshes the packing list view

### Regular Items
- Top note: "Note: changing categories or assignments here updates the master item and will apply to all lists."
- **Name field**: ✅ Editable
- **Category section**: ✅ Editable (required)
- **Member assignments**: ✅ Fully editable
- **Save button**: Enabled when name is non-empty AND category is selected
- After save: Shows "Item updated (applies to all lists)." and refreshes the view

## Testing
- ✅ All 115 tests pass
